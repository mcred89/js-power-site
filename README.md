# Workout Generator: JS edition

The code in this repo deploys a serverless React website into AWS S3.

Currently this repo only houses the static S3 site, but I plan on expanding the site to use API Gateway, Cognito, Lambda, and DynamoDB to house dynamic content.

Each component will get its own directory and each parent directory will have its own README.
