# Workout Generator: JS edition
## Static S3 Site

If you're wanting to reuse this code, you need to:
1. Set up Route53 for your domain
2. Set up ACM for your Route53 Domain. You can just make one cert with a '*'.<Domain> additional domain.
3. Set up your local AWS cli with your account creds.
And change these value in serverles.yaml:
4. The custom.siteNames should refelct your own domain names
5. Update the acmARN to your resource ARN from step 2.
6. [OPTIONAL] Update custom.aliasDNSName and provider.region to whatever AWS region you want. 

Note that the inital deploy of each stage takes a long time (15-20 minutes). This is CloudFront spin-up time.
